# Build container directly in K8S using Kaniko

Kaniko is an open source tool developed by Google (but not officially supported), allowing developers to build Docker images directly inside K8S without having to interact with a Docker Daemon.

## Description

In this course, we will demonstrate the need of a third party tool to build Docker images directly inside K8S. We will browse the tools we use locally, and explain why they are not usable in K8S.
